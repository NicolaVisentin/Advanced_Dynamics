# Experimental modal analysis for two different mechanical structures

The subject of this assignment is the experimental modal analysis, with the aim of extracting modal parameters and
modeshapes out of experimental data for two structures. The first structure is a very simple clamped beam, so an analytical
study is also included: this allows to generate mathematically the "experimental" data and also allows for a comparison
with the numerical results. The second structure is a rail wheel: here real data are used for the analysis.
Modal analysis is a very powerful approach, that allows to easily study a structure in a certain frequency range of interest
by using just few degrees of freedom, but still offering a good approximation of its behavior in that frequency range.
Matlab was used for the implementation and all the computations.
